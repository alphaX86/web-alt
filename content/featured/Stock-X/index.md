NN models designed to analyze and predict stock market from any stock data given. This is originally designed as a small research project and worked with a team of 4. Models trained and compared are RNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, XGBoost. Out of 4, CNN-LSTM returned the highest results during the experiment.
